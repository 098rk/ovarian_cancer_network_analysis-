Technical Limitations:
- Network size: 43 nodes (medium-scale)
- Edge types: Simplified to directed interactions
- Dynamics: Static analysis with dynamic validation
- Data source: Curated literature, not high-throughput

Computational Assumptions:
- Equal edge weights in initial analysis
- Binary interactions in Boolean model
- Homogeneous node properties
- Steady-state assumptions for some analyses
