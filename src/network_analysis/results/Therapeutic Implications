Computational Drug Targeting Recommendations:
1. Priority: p53 pathway reactivation (highest centrality)
2. Combination: NF-κB inhibition + DNA damage agents
3. Synthetic lethality: ATM/ATR inhibitors in p53 mutant
4. Resistance prevention: MDM2-p53 interaction blockers
5. Microenvironment: TNF-α/IL-6 pathway modulation
