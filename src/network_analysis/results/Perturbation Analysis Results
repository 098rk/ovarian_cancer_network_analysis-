# Node Knockout Simulations
Critical Nodes (network fragmentation):
- p53-p knockout: 65% network disruption
- ATMa-p knockout: 42% network disruption  
- NF-κB knockout: 38% network disruption

Resilient Nodes (minimal impact):
- Terminal phenotypes (apoptosis, cell cycle arrest)
- External inputs (IR)
