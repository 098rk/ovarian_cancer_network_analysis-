Cell Cycle - MAPK Cross-Talk Bridges:
1. MYC → Cyclin D1 (transcriptional regulation)
2. ERK1 → CDK2 (phosphorylation activation)
3. AKT1 → p21 (inhibition)
4. mTORC1 → Cyclin D1 (translation regulation)
5. RSK1 → Rb (phosphorylation)

Cross-Talk Strength Metrics:
- Number of inter-pathway edges: 23
- Cross-talk density: 0.034
- Information flow: Moderate (28% of signals cross pathways)
