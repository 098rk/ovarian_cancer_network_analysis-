Common Features:
1. Scale-free topology confirmed (both networks)
2. Hub-and-spoke organization
3. Modular structure with functional clusters
4. Robust yet targetable architecture
5. Extensive cross-talk capabilities

Unique Characteristics:
- Cell Cycle: More hierarchical, phase-based organization
- MAPK: More distributed, parallel processing
- Both exhibit biological optimal design principles
