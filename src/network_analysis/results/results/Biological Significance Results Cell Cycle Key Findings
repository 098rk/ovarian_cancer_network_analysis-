Critical Regulatory Nodes:
1. p53: Master regulator of DNA damage response
2. Cyclin D1: Primary G1 phase driver
3. E2F1: Key transcription factor hub
4. CDK2: S phase progression control
5. ATM: DNA damage sensing

Therapeutic Implications:
- CDK4/6 inhibitors target Cyclin D1-CDK4/6 complex
- p53 reactivation strategies
- E2F pathway modulation
- Checkpoint kinase inhibitors
